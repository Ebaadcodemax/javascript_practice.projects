                Hi, I'm Ebaad — An 18 year old curious, self-driven learner at the intersection of Computer Science, AI, and innovation.

I’ve begun a deep dive into Java, Data Structures & Algorithms, and App Development. With a strong foundation in Java, I’m steadily expanding my technical toolkit — mastering full-stack development and preparing for advanced AI engineering and research.

  <h2>🚀 My Goals</h2>
  <p>I’m not here to follow the crowd — I’m here to build. My ultimate goal is to create and scale an impactful AI startup during my college years, solving real problems with smart, scalable tech. Along the way, I’m committed to becoming an AI engineer and researcher, with a solid grasp on how intelligent systems work under the hood.</p>

  <h2>🧠 My Learning Journey</h2>
  <p><strong>Java:</strong> Completed a full course covering OOP, arrays, strings, functions, classes, autoboxing/unboxing, and operators — now diving into DSA.</p>
  <p><strong>Web Development:</strong> Learning HTML, CSS, and frontend effects, currently building my first portfolio with transitions, hover effects, and UI polish.</p>
  <p><strong>Open Source & Hackathons:</strong> Although I haven’t participated in any open source Hackathon, I am actively exploring short projects and upcoming hackathons to contribute, collaborate, and test ideas fast.</p>
